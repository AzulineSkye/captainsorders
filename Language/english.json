His eyes paused on a collection of words near the bottom: UES Contact Light. \n\n'Yes.' \n\nHe continued to read the document. The Safe Travels? For a rescue mission? As one of the few surviving captains of the old colony ships, he knew all the designations by memory – and the Safe Travels was not a rescue ship. \n\n'Any armaments?' \n\n'No.' \n\n'We'll have to fix that.' \n\nWith a sigh, he stood up. His prosthetics tugged at his joints – despite being lighter than his original limbs, they always felt heavy. \n\n'And let me guess - top secret, right?' \n\n'Yes.' \n\nHe gave out another sigh – they're always top secret - but a small smile crept onto his face. He glanced up to his old radio helmet. He's been bored in retirement anyways.",
